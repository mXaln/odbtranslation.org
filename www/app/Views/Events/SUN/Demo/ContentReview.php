                            <h4>Special concepts in this chapter</h4>
                            <h5>Elijah</h5>
                            <p>The Old Testament prophet Malachi lived many years before Jesus was born. Malachi had said that before the Messiah came a prophet named Elijah would return. Jesus explained that Malachi had been talking about John the Baptist. Jesus said this because John the Baptist had done what Malachi had said that Elijah would do. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/christ]]) </p>
                            <h5>"transfigured"</h5>
                            <p>Scripture often speaks of God's glory as a great, brilliant light. When people see this light, they are afraid. Matthew says in this chapter that Jesus' body shone with this glorious light so that his followers could see that Jesus truly was God's Son. At the same time, God told them that Jesus was his Son. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/glory]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/fear]])</p>

                            <p>The term "amen" is a word used to emphasize or call attention to what a person has said. It is often used at the end of a prayer. Sometimes it is translated as "truly."</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>When used at the end of a prayer, "amen" communicates agreement with the prayer or expresses a desire that the prayer be fulfilled.</li>
                                <li>In his teaching, Jesus used "amen" to emphasize the truth of what he said. He often followed that by "and I say to you" to introduce another teaching that related to the previous teaching.</li>
                                <li>When Jesus uses "amen" this way, some English versions (and the ULB) translate this as "verily" or "truly."</li>
                                <li>Another word meaning "truly" is sometimes translated as "surely" or "certainly" and is also used to emphasize what the speaker is saying.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h2>Translation Suggestions:</h2>
                            <ul>

                                <li>The term "beloved" literally means "loved (one)" or "(who is) loved."</li>
                                <li>God refers to Jesus as his "beloved Son."</li>

                                <li>Note that the word "beloved" comes from the word for God's love, which is unconditional, unselfish, and sacrificial.</li>

                            <p>The term "hour" is often used in the Bible to tell what time of day a certain event took place. It is also used figuratively to mean "time" or "moment."</p>

                                <li>The Jews counted daylight hours starting at sunrise (around 6 a.m.). For example, "the ninth hour" meant "around three in the afternoon."</li>
                                <li>Nighttime hours were counted starting at sunset (around 6 p.m.). For example, "the third hour of the night" meant "around nine in the evening" in our present-day system..</li>
                                <li>Since references to time in the Bible will not correspond exactly to the present-day time system, phrases such as "around nine" or "about six o'clock" could be used. </li>

                                <li>In the New Testament, the apostles often used "brothers" to refer to fellow Christians, including both men and women, since all believers in Christ are members of one spiritual family, with God as their heavenly Father.</li>
                                <li>A few times in the New Testament, the apostles used the term "sister" when referring specifically to a fellow Christian who was a woman, or to emphasize that both men and women are being included. For example, James emphasizes that he is talking about all believers when he refers to "a brother or sister who is in need of food or clothing."</li>

                                <li>In the Old Testament especially, when "brothers" is used very generally to refer to members of the same family, clan, or people group, possible translations could include "relatives" or "clan members" or "fellow Israelites."</li>
                                <li>In the context of referring to a fellow believer in Christ, this term could be translated as "brother in Christ" or "spiritual brother."</li>
                                <li>If both males and females are being referred to and "brother" would give a wrong meaning, then a more general kinship term could be used that would include both males and females.</li>
                                <li>Other ways to translate this term so that it refers to both male and female believers could be "fellow believers" or "Christian brothers and sisters."</li>

                            <p>Capernaum was a fishing village on the northwest shore of the Sea of Galilee.</p>

                                <li>Jesus lived in Capernaum whenever he was teaching in Galilee.</li>
                                <li>Several of his disciples were from Capernaum.</li>
                                <li>Jesus also did many miracles in this city, including bringing a dead girl back to life.</li>
                                <li>Capernaum was one of three cities that Jesus publicly rebuked because their people rejected him and did not believe his message. He warned them that God would punish them for their unbelief.</li>

                                <li>Some translators may prefer to translate "command" and "commandment" with the same word in their language.</li>

                                <li>In some languages, to "die" may be expressed as to "not live." The term "dead" may be translated as "not alive" or "not having any life" or "not living."</li>
                                <li>Many languages use figurative expressions to describe death, such as to "pass away" in English. However, in the Bible it is best to use the most direct term for death that is used in everyday language.</li>
                                <li>In the Bible, physical life and death are often compared to spiritual life and death. It is important in a translation to use the same word or phrase for both physical death and spiritual death.</li>
                                <li>In some languages it may be more clear to say "spiritual death" when the context requires that meaning. Some translators may also feel it is best to say "physical death" in contexts where it is being contrasted to spiritual death.</li>
                                <li>The expression "the dead" is a nominal adjective that refers to people who have died. Some languages will translate this as "dead people" or "people who have died." (See: <b>nominal adjective</b>)</li>
                                <li>The expression "put to death" could also be translated as "kill" or "murder" or "execute."</li>

                            <p>The term "hour" is often used in the Bible to tell what time of day a certain event took place. It is also used figuratively to mean "time" or "moment."</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The Jews counted daylight hours starting at sunrise (around 6 a.m.). For example, "the ninth hour" meant "around three in the afternoon."</li>
                                <li>Nighttime hours were counted starting at sunset (around 6 p.m.). For example, "the third hour of the night" meant "around nine in the evening" in our present-day system..</li>
                                <li>Since references to time in the Bible will not correspond exactly to the present-day time system, phrases such as "around nine" or "about six o'clock" could be used. </li>
                                <li>Some translations might add phrases like "in the evening" or "in the morning" or "in the afternoon" to make it clear what time of day is being talked about.</li>
                                <li>The phrase, "in that hour" could be translated as, "at that time" or "in that moment."</li>
                                <li>Referring to Jesus, the expression "his hour had come" could be translated as, "the time had come for him to" or "the appointed time for him had come."</li>

                            <p>Jesus is God's Son. The name "Jesus" means "Yahweh saves." The term "Christ" is a title that means "anointed one" and is another word for Messiah.</p>

                                <li>In a miraculous way, the Holy Spirit caused the eternal Son of God to be born as a human being. His mother was told by an angel to call him "Jesus" because he was destined to save people from their sins.</li>
                                <li>Jesus did many miracles that revealed that he is God and that he is the Christ, or the Messiah.</li>

                                <li>For the term "Christ," some translators may prefer to use only some form of the term "Messiah" throughout.</li>

                            <p>The terms "kind" and "kinds" refer to groups or classifications of things that are connected by shared characteristics.</p>

                                <li>In the Bible, this term is specifically used to refer to the distinctive kinds of plants and animals that God made when he created the world.</li>
                                <li>Often there are many different variations or species within each "kind." For example, horses, zebras, and donkeys are all members of the same "kind," but they are different species.</li>
                                <li>The main thing that distinguishes each "kind" as a separate group is that members of that group can reproduce more of their same "kind." Members of different kinds cannot do that with each other.</li>

                            <p>There are several figurative uses of the term "light" in the Bible. It is often used as a metaphor for righteousness, holiness, and truth. (See: <b>Metaphor</b>)</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Jesus said, "I am the light of the world" to express that he brings God's true message to the world and rescues people from the darkness of their sin.</li>
                                <li>Christians are commanded to "walk in the light," which means they should be living the way God wants them to and avoiding evil.</li>
                                <li>The apostle John stated that "God is light" and in him there is no darkness at all.</li>
                                <li>Light and darkness are complete opposites. Darkness is the absence of all light. </li>
                                <li>Jesus said that he was "the light of the world" and that his followers should shine like lights in the world by living in a way that clearly shows how great God is.</li>
                                <li>"Walking in the light" represents living in a way that pleases God, doing what is good and right. Walking in darkness represents living in rebellion against God, doing evil things.</li>
                            </ul>

                                <li>When translating, it is important to keep the literal terms "light" and "darkness" even when they are used figuratively.</li>
                                <li>It may be necessary to explain the comparison in the text. For example, "walk as children of light" could be translated as, "live openly righteous lives, like someone who walks in bright sunlight."</li>
                                <li>Make sure that the translation of "light" does not refer to an object that gives light, such as a lamp. The translation of this term should refer to the light itself.</li>

                                <li>The term "seed" is used figuratively and euphemistically to refer to the tiny cells inside a man that combine with cells of a woman to cause a baby to grow inside her. A collection of these is called semen.</li>
                                <li>Related to this, "seed" is also used to refer to a person's offspring or descendants.</li>
                                <li>This word often has a plural meaning, referring to more than one seed grain or more than one descendant.</li>

                                <li>For a literal seed, it is best to use the literal term for "seed" that is used in the target language for what a farmer plants in his field.</li>
                                <li>The literal term should also be used in contexts where it refers figuratively to God's Word.</li>
                                <li>For the figurative use that refers to people who are of the same family line, it may be more clear to use the word "descendant" or "descendants" instead of seed. Some languages may have a word that means "children and grandchildren."</li>
                                <li>For a man or woman's "seed," consider how the target expresses this in a way that will not offend or embarrass people. (See: <b>euphemism</b>)</li>

                                <li>The term "sinner" was also used for people who were considered to be worse sinners than other people. For example, this label was given to tax collectors and prostitutes.</li>

                            <h2>Definition:</h2>
                            <p>The male offspring of a man and a woman is called their "son" for his entire life. He is also called a son of that man and a son of that woman. An "adopted son" is a male who has been legally placed into the position of being a son.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>"Son" was often used figuratively in the Bible to refer to any male descendant, such as a grandson or great-grandson.</li>
                                <li>The term "son" can also be used as a polite form of address to a boy or man who is younger than the speaker.</li>
                                <li>Sometimes "sons of God" was used in the New Testament to refer to believers in Christ.</li>
                                <li>God called Israel his "firstborn son." This refers to God's choosing of the nation of Israel to be his special people. It is through them that God's message of redemption and salvation came, with the result that many other people have become his spiritual children.</li>
                                <li>The phrase "son of" often has the figurative meaning "person having the characteristics of." Examples of this include "sons of the light," "sons of disobedience," "a son of peace," and "sons of thunder."</li>
                                <li>The phrase "son of" is also used to tell who a person's father is. This phrase is used in genealogies and many other places.</li>
                                <li>Using "son of" to give the name of the father frequently helps distinguish people who have the same name. For example, "Azariah son of Zadok" and "Azariah son of Nathan" in 1 Kings 4, and "Azariah son of Amaziah" in 2 Kings 15 are three different men.</li>

                                <li>In most occurrences of this term, it is best to translate "son" by the literal term in the language that is used to refer to a son.</li>
                                <li>When translating the term "Son of God," the project language's common term for "son" should be used.</li>
                                <li>When used to refer to a descendant rather than a direct son, the term "descendant" could be used, as in referring to Jesus as the "descendant of David" or in genealogies where sometimes "son" referred to a male descendant who was not an actual son.</li>
                                <li>Sometimes "sons" can be translated as "children," when both males and females are being referred to. For example, "sons of God" could be translated as "children of God" since this expression also includes girls and women.</li>
                                <li>The figurative expression "son of" could also be translated as "someone who has the characteristics of" or "someone who is like" or "someone who has" or "someone who acts like."</li>

                            <p>The term "Son of God" refers to Jesus, the Word of God, who came into the world as a human being. He is also often referred to as "the Son."</p>

                                <li>The Son of God has the same nature as God the Father, and is fully God.</li>
                                <li>God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit are all of one essence.</li>
                                <li>Unlike human sons, the Son of God has always existed.</li>
                                <li>In the beginning, the Son of God was active in creating the world, along with the Father and the Holy Spirit.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Because Jesus is God's Son, he loves and obeys his Father, and his Father loves him.</p>

                                <li>Make sure the word used to translate "son" fits with the word used to translate "father" and that these words are the most natural ones used to express a true father-son relationship in the project language.</li>
                                <li>Using a capital letter to begin "Son" may help show that this is talking about God.</li>

                            <p>The terms "tax" and "taxes" refer to money or goods that people pay to a government that is in authority over them. A "tax collector" was a government worker whose job was to receive money that people were required to pay the government in taxes.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The amount of money that is paid as a tax is usually based on the value of an item or on how much a person's property is worth.</li>
                                <li>In the time of Jesus and and the apostles, the Roman government required taxes from everyone living in the Roman empire, including the Jews.</li>
                                <li>If taxes are not paid, the government can take legal action against a person to get the money that is owed.</li>
                                <li>Joseph and Mary traveled to Bethlehem to be counted in the census held to tax everyone living in the Roman empire.</li>
                                <li>The term "tax" could also be translated as, "required payment" or "government money" or "temple money," depending on the context.</li>
                                <li>To "pay taxes" could also be translated as to "pay money to the government" or "receive money for the government" or "make the required payment." To "collect taxes" could be translated as to "receive money for the government.</li>
                                <li>A "tax collector" is someone who works for the government and receives the money that people are required to pay it.</li>
                                <li>The people who collected taxes for the Roman government would often demand more money from the people than the government required. The tax collectors would keep the extra amount for themselves.</li>
                                <li>Because tax collectors cheated people in this way, the Jews considered them to be among the worst of sinners.</li>
                                <li>The Jews also considered Jewish tax collectors to be traitors to their own people because they worked for the Roman government which was oppressing the Jewish people.</li>
                                <li>The phrase, "tax collectors and sinners" was a common expression in the New Testament, showing how much the Jews despised tax collectors.</li>

                            <p>34:06 He said, "Two men went to the Temple to pray. One of them was a tax collector, and the other was a religious leader."
                                34:07 "The religious leader prayed like this, 'Thank you, God, that I am not a sinner like other men—such as robbers, unjust men, adulterers, or even like that tax collector.'"
                                34:09 "But the tax collector stood far away from the religious ruler, did not even look up to heaven. Instead, he pounded on his chest and prayed, 'God, please be merciful to me because I am a sinner.'"
                                34:10 Then Jesus said, "I tell you the truth, God heard the tax collector's prayer and declared him to be righteous."
                                35:01 One day, Jesus was teaching many tax collectors and other sinners who had gathered to hear him.

                            <p>The term "vision" refers to something that a person sees. It especially refers to something unusual or supernatural that God shows people in order to give them a message.</p>

                                <li>Usually, visions are seen while the person is awake. However, sometimes a vision is something a person sees in a dream while asleep.</li>
                                <li>God sends visions to tell people something that is very important. For example, Peter was shown a vision to tell him that God wanted him to welcome Gentiles.</li>

                                <li>The phrase "saw a vision" could be translated as "saw something unusual from God" or "God showed him something special."</li>
                                <li>Some languages may not have separate words for "vision" and "dream." So a sentence such as "Daniel had dreams and visions in his mind" could be translated as something like "Daniel was dreaming while asleep and God caused him to see unusual things."</li>

                                <li>"Streams of living water will flow from them" could be translated as "the power and blessings from the Holy Spirit will flow out of them them like streams of water." Instead of "blessings" the term "gifts" or "fruits" or "godly character" could be used.</li>
                                <li>When Jesus is talking to the Samaritan woman at the well, the phrase "living water" could be translated as "water that gives life" or "lifegiving water." In this context, the imagery of water must be kept in the translation.</li>
                                <li>Depending on the context, the term "waters" or "many waters" could be translated as "great suffering (that surrounds you like water)" or "overwhelming difficulties (like a flood of water)" or "large amounts of water."</li>

                            <h2>Definition:</h2>
                            <p>The terms "well" and "cistern" refer to two different kinds of sources for water in Bible times.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>A well is a deep hole dug into the ground so that underground water can flow into it.</li>
                                <li>A cistern is a deep hole dug into rock that was used as a holding tank for collecting rain water.</li>
                                <li>Cisterns were usually dug into rock and sealed with plaster to keep the water in. A "broken cistern" happened when the plaster became cracked so that the water leaked out.</li>
                                <li>Cisterns were often located in the courtyard area of people's homes to catch the rainwater that would run off the roof.</li>
                                <li>Wells were often located where they could be accessed by several families or a whole community.</li>
                                <li>Because water was very important for both people and livestock, the right to use a well was often a cause of strife and conflict.</li>
                                <li>Both wells and cisterns were usually covered with a large stone to prevent anything falling in it. Often there was a rope with a bucket or pot attached to it to bring the water up to the surface.</li>
                                <li>Sometimes a dry cistern was used as a place to imprison someone, such as happened to Joseph and Jeremiah.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h2>Translation Suggestions:</h2>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Ways to translate "well" could include "deep water hole" or "deep hole for spring water" or "deep hole for drawing water."</li>
                                <li>The term "cistern" could be translated as "stone water pit" or "deep and narrow pit for water" or "underground tank for holding water."</li>
                                <li>These terms are similar in meaning. The main difference is that a well continually receives water from underground springs, whereas a cistern is a holding tank for water that usually comes from rain.</li>
