                            <h4>Structure and formatting</h4>
                            <p>Some translations set words farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULB does this with verses 11-13. Paul may be quoting a poem or hymn in these verses.</p>
                            <h4>Special concepts in this chapter</h4>
                            <h5>We will reign with him</h5>
                            <p>Faithful Christians will reign with Christ in the future. (See: rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faithful)</p>
                            <h4>Important figures of speech in this chapter</h4>
                            <h5>Analogies</h5>
                            <p>In this chapter, Paul makes several analogies to teach about living as a Christian. He uses analogies of soldiers, athletes, and farmers. Later in the chapter, he uses the analogy of different kinds of containers in a house.</p>

                            <h1>Connecting Statement:</h1>
                            <p>Paul pictures Timothy's Christian life as a soldier's life, as a farmer's life, and as an athlete's life.</p>
                            <h1>my child</h1>
                            <p>Here "child" is a term of great love and approval.

                            <p>Possible meanings are 1) "God's truth is like a firm foundation" or 2) "God has established his people like a building on a firm foundation" or 3) "God's faithfulness is like a firm foundation." In any case, Paul speaks of this idea as if it were a building's foundation laid in the ground. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])</p>

                            <p>He is not set apart physically or in the sense of location, but instead to fulfill a purpose. Some versions translate this "sanctified," but the text signals the essential idea of being set apart. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])</p>

Alternate translation: "Try your best to obtain righteousness" or "Seek after righteousness" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])</p>

                            <p>In the Bible, the term "child" is often used to generally refer to someone who is young in age, including an infant. The term "children" is the plural form and it also has several figurative uses.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>In the Bible, disciples or followers are sometimes called "children."</li>
                                <li>Often the term "children" is used to refer to a person's descendants.</li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>The phrase "children of" can refer to being characterized by something. Some examples of this would be:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>children of the light </li>
                                        <li>children of obedience </li>
                                        <li>children of the devil </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>This term can also refer to people who are like spiritual children. For example, "children of God" refers to people who belong to God through faith in Jesus.</li>
                            </ul>

                                <li>The term "children" could be translated as "descendants" when it is referring to a person's great-grandchildren or great-great-grandchildren, etc.</li>
                                <li>Depending on the context, "children of" could be translated as, "people who have the characteristics of" or "people who behave like."</li>
                                <li>If possible, the phrase, "children of God" should be translated literally since an important biblical theme is that God is our heavenly Father. A possible translation alternate would be, "people who belong to God" or "God's spiritual children."</li>
                                <li>When Jesus calls his disciples "children," this could also be translated as, "dear friends" or "my beloved disciples."</li>
                                <li>When Paul and John refer to believers in Jesus as "children," this could also be translated as "dear fellow believers."</li>
                                <li>The phrase, "children of the promise" could be translated as, "people who have received what God promised them."</li>

                            <p>This term is used to refer to both physical and spiritual death. Physically, it refers to when the physical body of a person stops living. Spiritually, it refers to sinners being separated from a holy God because of their sin.</p>
                            <h2>1. Physical death</h2>
                            <ul>
                                <li>To "die" means to stop living. Death is the end of physical life.</li>
                                <li>A person's spirit leaves his body when he dies.</li>
                                <li>When Adam and Eve sinned, physical death came into the world.</li>
                                <li>The expression "put to death" refers to killing or murdering someone, especially when a king or other ruler gives an order for someone to be killed.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h2>2. Spiritual death</h2>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Spiritual death is the separation of a person from God.</li>
                                <li>Adam died spiritually when he disobeyed God. His relationship with God was broken. He became ashamed and tried to hide from God.</li>
                                <li>Every descendant of Adam is a sinner, and is spiritually dead. God makes us spiritually alive again when we have faith in Jesus Christ.</li>

                                <li>To translate this term, it is best to use the everyday, natural word or expression in the target language that refers to death.</li>
                                <li>In some languages, to "die" may be expressed as to "not live." The term "dead" may be translated as "not alive" or "not having any life" or "not living."</li>
                                <li>Many languages use figurative expressions to describe death, such as to "pass away" in English. However, in the Bible it is best to use the most direct term for death that is used in everyday language.</li>
                                <li>In the Bible, physical life and death are often compared to spiritual life and death. It is important in a translation to use the same word or phrase for both physical death and spiritual death.</li>
                                <li>In some languages it may be more clear to say "spiritual death" when the context requires that meaning. Some translators may also feel it is best to say "physical death" in contexts where it is being contrasted to spiritual death.</li>
                                <li>The expression "the dead" is a nominal adjective that refers to people who have died. Some languages will translate this as "dead people" or "people who have died." (See: <b>nominal adjective</b>)</li>
                                <li>The expression "put to death" could also be translated as "kill" or "murder" or "execute."</li>

                                <li>These false gods or goddesses do not exist. Yahweh is the only God.</li>
                                <li>People sometimes make objects into idols to worship as symbols of their false gods.</li>
                                <li>In the Bible, God's people frequently turned away from obeying him in order to worship false gods.</li>
                                <li>Demons often deceive people into believing that the false gods and idols they worship have power.</li>
                                <li>Baal, Dagon, and Molech were three of the many false gods that were worshiped by people in Bible times.</li>

                            <p>An idol is an object that people make so they can worship it. Something is described as "idolatrous" if it involves giving honor to something other than the one true God.</p>

                                <li>Sometimes demons work through an idol to make it seem like it has power, even though it does not.</li>
                                <li>Idols are often made of valuable materials like gold, silver, bronze, or expensive wood.</li>
                                <li>An "idolatrous kingdom" means a "kingdom of people who worship idols" or a "kingdom of people who worship earthly things."</li>

                                <li>Glory is especially used to describe God, who is more glorious than anyone or anything in the universe. Everything in his character reveals his glory and his splendor.</li>

                                <li>When the Bible says that God glorifies himself, it means that he reveals to people his amazing greatness, often through miracles.</li>
                                <li>God the Father will glorify God the Son by revealing to people the Son's perfection, splendor, and greatness.</li>
                                <li>Everyone who believes in Christ will be glorified with him. When they are raised to life, they will be changed to reflect his glory and to display his grace to all creation.</li>

                            <p>The phrase "in Christ" and related terms refer to the state or condition of being in relationship with Jesus Christ through faith in him.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Other related terms include "in Christ Jesus, in Jesus Christ, in the Lord Jesus, in the Lord Jesus Christ."</li>
                                <li>Possible meanings for the term "in Christ" could include "because you belong to Christ" or "through the relationship you have with Christ" or "based on your faith in Christ."</li>
                                <li>These related terms all have the same meaning of being in a state of believing in Jesus and being his disciple.</li>
                                <li>Note: Sometimes the word "in" belongs with the verb. For example, "share in Christ" means to "share in" the benefits that come from knowing Christ. To "glory in" Christ means to be glad and give praise to God for who Jesus is and what he has done. To "believe in" Christ means to trust him as Savior and know him.</li>

                            <p>Jesus is God's Son. The name "Jesus" means "Yahweh saves." The term "Christ" is a title that means "anointed one" and is another word for Messiah.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The two names are often combined as "Jesus Christ" or "Christ Jesus." These names emphasize that God's Son is the Messiah, who came to save people from being punished eternally for their sins.</li>
                                <li>In a miraculous way, the Holy Spirit caused the eternal Son of God to be born as a human being. His mother was told by an angel to call him "Jesus" because he was destined to save people from their sins.</li>
                                <li>Jesus did many miracles that revealed that he is God and that he is the Christ, or the Messiah.</li>

                                <li>In many languages "Jesus" and "Christ" are spelled in a way that keeps the sounds or spelling as close to the original as possible. For example, "Jesucristo," "Jezus Christus," "Yesus Kristus", and "Hesukristo" are some of the ways that these names are translated into different languages.</li>
                                <li>For the term "Christ," some translators may prefer to use only some form of the term "Messiah" throughout.</li>
                                <li>Also consider how these names are spelled in a nearby local or national language.</li>

                            <h2>1. Physical life</h2>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Physical life is the presence of the spirit in the body. God breathed life into Adam's body, and he became a living being.</li>

                                <li>Sometimes the word "life" refers to the experience of living as in, "his life was enjoyable."</li>
                                <li>It can also refer to a person's lifespan, as in the expression, "the end of his life."</li>
                                <li>The term "living" may refer to being physically alive, as in "my mother is still living." It may also refer to dwelling somewhere as in, "they were living in the city."</li>
                                <li>In the Bible, the concept of "life" is often contrasted with the concept of "death."</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h2>2. Spiritual life</h2>
                            <ul>
                                <li>A person has spiritual life when he believes in Jesus with God gives that person a transformed life with the Holy Spirit living in him.</li>
                                <li>This life is also called "eternal life" to indicate that it does not end.</li>
                                <li>The opposite of spiritual life is spiritual death, which means being separated from God and experiencing eternal punishment.</li>

                            <p>To love another person is to care for that person and do things that will benefit him. There are different meanings for "love" some languages may express using different words:</p>

                                <li>The kind of love that comes from God is focused on the good of others even when it doesn't benefit oneself. This kind of love cares for others, no matter what they do. God himself is love and is the source of true love.</li>

                                <li>Jesus showed this kind of love by sacrificing his life in order to rescue us from sin and death. He also taught his followers to love others sacrificially.</li>
                                <li>When people love others with this kind of love, they act in ways that show they are thinking of what will cause the others to thrive. This kind of love especially includes forgiving others.</li>
                                <li>In the ULB, the word "love" refers to this kind of sacrificial love, unless a Translation Note indicates a different meaning.</li>

                                <li>The term can also be used in such contexts as, "They love to sit in the most important seats at a banquet." This means that they "like very much" or "greatly desire" to do that.</li>

                                <li>In the figurative expression "Jacob I have loved, but Esau I have hated," the term "loved" refers to God's choosing of Jacob to be in a covenant relationship with him. This could also be translated as "chosen." Although Esau was also blessed by God, he wasn't given the privilege of being in the covenant. The term "hated" is used figuratively here to mean "rejected" or "not chosen."</li>

                                <li>Some languages may have a special word for the kind of unselfish, sacrificial love that God has. Ways to translate this might include, "devoted, faithful caring" or "care for unselfishly" or "love from God."

                                <li>These terms especially refer to living in a way that disobeys God's teachings and commands.</li>

                            <p>A seed is the part of a plant that gets planted in the ground to reproduce more of the same kind of plant. It also has several figurative meanings.</p>

                                <li>The term "seed" is used figuratively and euphemistically to refer to the tiny cells inside a man that combine with cells of a woman to cause a baby to grow inside her. A collection of these is called semen.</li>
                                <li>Related to this, "seed" is also used to refer to a person's offspring or descendants.</li>
                                <li>This word often has a plural meaning, referring to more than one seed grain or more than one descendant.</li>
                                <li>In the parable of the farmer planting seeds, Jesus compared his seeds to the Word of God, which is planted in people's hearts in order to produce good spiritual fruit.</li>
                                <li>The apostle Paul also uses the term "seed" to refer to the Word of God.</li>

                                <li>The literal term should also be used in contexts where it refers figuratively to God's Word.</li>
                                <li>For the figurative use that refers to people who are of the same family line, it may be more clear to use the word "descendant" or "descendants" instead of seed. Some languages may have a word that means "children and grandchildren."</li>

                            <h2>Definition:</h2>
                            <p>The word for "servant" can also mean "slave" and refers to a person who works for another person, either by choice or by force. The surrounding text usually makes it clear whether a person is a servant or a slave. The word for "serve" means to do things to help other people. It can also mean to "worship." In Bible times, there was less of a difference between a servant and a slave than there is today. Both servants and slaves were an important part of their master's household and many were treated almost like members of the family. Sometimes a servant would choose to become a lifetime servant to his master.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>A slave was a kind of servant who was the property of the person he worked for. The person who bought a slave was called his "owner" or "master." Some masters treated their slaves very cruelly, while other masters treated their slaves very well, as a servant who was a valued member of the household.</li>
                                <li>In ancient times, some people willingly became slaves to a person they owed money to in order to pay off their debt to that person.</li>
                                <li>In the context of a person serving guests, this term means "care for" or "serve food to" or "provide food for." When Jesus told the disciples to "serve" the fish to the people, this could be translated as, "distribute" or "hand out" or "give."</li>
                                <li>In the Bible, the phrase "I am your servant" was used as a sign of respect and service to a person of higher rank, such as a king. It did not mean that the person speaking was an actual servant.</li>
                                <li>The term "serve" can also be translated as "minister to" or "work for" or "take care of" or "obey," depending on the context.</li>
                                <li>In the Old Testament, God's prophets and other people who worshiped God were often referred to as his "servants."</li>
                                <li>To "serve God" can be translated as to "worship and obey God" or to "do the work that God has commanded."</li>
                                <li>In the New Testament, people who obeyed God through faith in Christ were often called his "servants."</li>
                                <li>To "serve tables" means to bring food to people who are sitting at tables, or more generally, to "distribute food."</li>
                                <li>People who teach others about God are said to serve both God and the ones they are teaching.</li>
                                <li>The apostle Paul wrote to the Corinthian Christians about how they used to "serve" the old covenant. This refers to obeying the laws of Moses. Now they "serve" the new covenant. That is, because of Jesus' sacrifice on the cross, believers in Jesus are enabled by the Holy Spirit to please God and live holy lives.</li>
                                <li>Paul talks about their actions in terms of their "service" to either the old or new covenant. This could be translated as "serving" or "obeying" or "devotion to."</li>
                                <li>Christians are also called "slaves to righteousness," which is a metaphor that compares the commitment to obey God to a slave's commitment to obey his master. </li>

                            <p>The terms "snare" and "trap" refer to devices that are used to catch animals and keep them from escaping. To "snare" or "ensnare" is to catch with a snare, and to "trap" or "entrap" is to catch with a trap.

                                <li>Usually the snare or trap is hidden so that its prey is taken by surprise.</li>
                                <li>The phrase "set a trap" means to get a trap ready to capture something.</li>
                                <li>To "fall into a trap" refers to falling into a deep hole or pit that was dug and hidden in order to catch an animal.</li>
                                <li>A person who is starts sinning and cannot stop can be described as "ensnared by sin" in a figurative reference to the way an animal can be ensnared and cannot escape.</li>
                                <li>Just as an animal is endangered and hurt by being in a trap, so a person caught in the trap of sin is being harmed by that sin and needs to be set free.</li>

                            <p>To "trust" something or someone is to believe that the thing or person is true or dependable. That belief is also called "trust." A "trustworthy" person is one you can trust to do and say what is right and true, and therefore one who has the quality of "trustworthiness."</p>

                                <li>Trust is closely related to faith. If we trust someone, we have faith in that person to do what they promised to do.</li>
                                <li>Having trust in someone also means depending on that person.</li>
                                <li>To "trust in" Jesus means to believe that he is God, to believe that he died on the cross to pay for our sins, and to rely on him to save us.</li>
                                <li>A "trustworthy saying" refers to something that is said that can be counted on to be true.</li>

                                <li>Usually the term "warrior" is a general, broad term to refer to a man who is gifted and courageous in battle.</li>
                                <li>Yahweh is figuratively described as a "warrior."</li>
                                <li>The term "soldier" more specifically refers to someone who belongs to a certain army or who is fighting in a certain battle.</li>
                                <li>Roman soldiers in Jerusalem were there to keep order and to carry out duties such as executing prisoners. They guarded Jesus before crucifying him and some were ordered to stand guard at his tomb.</li>
                                <li>The translator should consider whether there are two words in the project language for "warrior" and "soldier" that also differ in meaning and use.</li>

                            <p>A sword is a flat-bladed metal weapon used to cut or stab. It has a handle and a long, pointed blade with a very sharp cutting edge.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>In ancient times the length of a sword’s blade was about 60 to 91 centimeters.</li>
                                <li>Some swords have two sharp edges and are called "double-edged" or "two-edged" swords.</li>
                                <li>Jesus' disciples had swords for self defense. With his sword, Peter cut off the ear of the high priest's servant.</li>
                                <li>Both John the Baptist and the apostle James were beheaded with swords.</li>

                                <li>A sword is used as a metaphor for God's word. God's teachings in the Bible exposed people's innermost thoughts and convicted them of their sin. In a similar way, a sword cuts deeply, causing pain. (See: <b>Metaphor</b>)</li>
                                <li>One way to translate this figurative use would be, "God's word is like a sword, which cuts deeply and exposes sin."</li>
                                <li>Another figurative use of this term occurred in the book of Psalms, where the tongue or speech of a person was compared to a sword, which can injure people. This could be translated as "the tongue is like a sword that can badly injure someone."</li>
                                <li>If swords are not known in your culture, this word could be translated with the name of another long-bladed weapon that is used to cut or stab.</li>
                                <li>A sword could also be described as a "sharp weapon" or "long knife." Some translations could include a picture of a sword.</li>

                            <h2>Definition:</h2>
                            <p>In the Bible, the term "word of God" refers to anything that God has communicated to people. This includes spoken and written messages. Jesus is also called "the Word of God."</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The term "scriptures" means "writings." It is only used in the New Testament and refers to the Hebrew scriptures, which is the Old Testament. These writings were God's message that he had told people to write down so that many years in the future people could still read it. </li>
                                <li>The related terms "word of Yahweh" and "word of the Lord" often refer to a specific message from God that was given to a prophet or other person in the Bible.</li>
                                <li>Sometimes this term occurs as simply "the word" or "my word" or "your word" (when talking about God's word).</li>
                                <li>In the New Testament, Jesus is called "the Word" and "the Word of God." These titles mean that Jesus fully reveals who God is, because he is God himself.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The term "word of truth" is another way of referring to "God's word," which is his message or teaching. It does not refer to just one word.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>God's word of truth includes everything that God has taught people about himself, his creation, and his plan of salvation through Jesus.</li>
                                <li>This term emphasizes the fact that what God has told us is true, faithful, and real.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h2>Translation Suggestions:</h2>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Depending on the context, other ways to translate this term could include "the message of Yahweh" or "God's message" or "the teachings from God."</li>
                                <li>It may be more natural in some languages to make this term plural and say "God's words" or "the words of Yahweh."</li>
                                <li>The expression "the word of Yahweh came" is often used to introduce something that God told his prophets or his people. This could be translated as "Yahweh spoke this message" or "Yahweh spoke these words."</li>
                                <li>The term "scripture" or "scriptures" could be translated as "the writings" or "the written message from God." This term should be translated differently from the translation of the term "word."</li>
                                <li>When "word" occurs alone and it refers to God's word, it could be translated as "the message" or "God's word" or "the teachings." Also consider the alternate translations suggested above.</li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>When the Bible refers to Jesus as "the Word," this term could be translated as "the Message" or "the Truth."</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>"Word of truth" could be translated as "God's true message" or "God's word, which is true."</li>
                                <li>It is important for the translation of this term to include the meaning of being true.</li>

                                <li>God's "works" and the "work of his hands" are expressions that refer to all the things he does or has done, including creating the world, saving sinners, providing for the needs of all creation and keeping the entire universe in place. The terms "deeds" and "acts" are also used to refer to God's miracles in expressions such as "mighty acts" or "marvelous deeds."</li>
                                <li>The works or deeds that a person does can be either good or evil.</li>
                                <li>The Holy Spirit empowers believers to do good works, which are also called "good fruit."</li>
                                <li>People are not saved by their good works; they are saved through faith in Jesus.</li>
                                <li>A person's "work" can be what he does to earn a living or to serve God. The Bible also refers to God as "working."</li>
